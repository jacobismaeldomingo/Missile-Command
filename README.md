# Missile-Command
A Object-Oriented Programming Python game that uses Turtle Graphics to simulate the old popular Arcade game Missile Command.

## Specs for Missile Command
Missile Command is an old arcade game. The player has 6 cities and 3 silos, the objective of the game is the player must protect these cities and
silos from an endless hail of enemy missiles. 

The player has 30 missiles every level, so keep track of how many missiles have been fired. The silos, who have 10 missiles each, will be useless 
when all of its containing missiles are fired. To stop or destroy the enemy missiles the player will use his/her mouse to point a direction where 
the player’s missile will go and destroy the enemy missile. 

The game is staged as a series of levels of increasing difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy missiles. The enemy missiles 
will randomly attack the cities and silos; being struck by an enemy missile results in the destruction of the city or silo. A level ends when all 
enemy missiles are destroyed or reach its target.

A player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level and the player missiles cannot shoot below the silos. At the
conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for any remaining cities, silos or unused missiles. The feature added in the game is that there
are different types of enemy missiles, who also act differently from each other. The game will end when all the cities and silos are destroyed.

## Enemy Missiles
Normal enemy missiles - normal enemy missiles that just go straight to cities and silos.  
Invaders Missiles - like normal enemy missiles but they are much faster than them and they only appear every 5th count.  
Side Missiles - they are normal missiles but they spawn at the side of the screen and faster than other missiles. They show every 3rd count.

Invader missiles = 20 points

Side missiles = 30 points

Remaining Cities after every level = 100 points
